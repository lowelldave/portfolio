        I create apps, tools, from scratch using Javascript frameworks like
        React and Vue. I'm also passionate and intricate on designs and details
        of the page to make it better and presentable. I'm trained in pressure
        and learned how to be adaptive for new tech quickly to be up-to-date
        with the trends and standards.

      <p className="about-me__description">
        Ever since my school days I like designing things, like posters, logos,
        newspaper layout, then when I got to college, it turns that I can code
        too! Since I had experience using editing tools, I get the hang of
        things easily in designing, especially for the frontend side. So making
        things short, I'm pretty much a programmer but a designer at heart,
        that's why UI/UX is very important to me as a person and as a developer.
        I'm careful with the UI that I worked on, because as much I want to
        satisfy myself with the UI of the page, I also want the users to be able
        to understand the page as easy as it can be while pleasing to the eyes.
